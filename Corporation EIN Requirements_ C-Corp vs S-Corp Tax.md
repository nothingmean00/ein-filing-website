# Corporation EIN Requirements: C-Corp vs S-Corp Tax ID Needs

Both C-Corporations and S-Corporations are required to obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)[^1][^2]. While the EIN requirement is universal for both corporate structures, understanding the specific applications and implications of this tax ID can help business owners navigate their corporate responsibilities more effectively.

## Universal EIN Requirement for All Corporations

**All corporations, regardless of their tax election, must obtain an EIN**[^3][^4]. This federal requirement applies whether your corporation chooses C-Corp or S-Corp tax status, has employees or not, and operates in any state across the United States[^1][^4]. The EIN serves as your corporation's unique nine-digit identifier for all federal tax purposes, functioning similarly to how a Social Security Number identifies individuals[^4][^5].

Corporations need an EIN to fulfill several critical business functions, including filing federal tax returns, opening business bank accounts, obtaining business loans, applying for business licenses, and establishing business credit[^5][^6]. Even if your corporation never hires employees, the EIN remains mandatory for corporate entities[^4].

## C-Corporation EIN Requirements

C-Corporations face strict EIN requirements under current tax law[^7]. **All C-Corporations must file Form SS-4 to obtain an employer identification number**[^1]. This requirement exists because C-Corporations are recognized as separate taxpaying entities that must file their own federal income tax returns using Form 1120[^2][^8].

### C-Corp Tax Filing Requirements

C-Corporations use their EIN when filing Form 1120, the U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return[^8][^9]. **The corporate tax return is generally due by the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of the corporation's tax year**[^10], which means April 15 for calendar-year corporations[^11]. C-Corporations that are required to file 10 or more returns in a calendar year must e-file their Forms 1120, effective for returns required to be filed on or after January 1, 2024[^2].

The EIN is essential for C-Corporations because they face double taxation - profits are taxed at the corporate level and again when distributed to shareholders as dividends[^2][^12]. This separate tax identity requires the distinct federal identification number.

## S-Corporation EIN Requirements

**S-Corporations must also obtain and maintain an EIN for federal tax purposes**[^13][^14]. While S-Corporations are pass-through entities that don't pay corporate income taxes, they still must file informational returns and handle various tax responsibilities that require the EIN[^13][^14].

### S-Corp Tax Filing Requirements

S-Corporations use their EIN when filing Form 1120-S, the U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation[^14][^15]. **S-Corporations must file Form 1120-S by the 15th day of the third month after the end of their tax year**[^14][^16], which means March 15 for calendar-year S-Corps (or March 17, 2025, since March 15 falls on a weekend)[^16].

The EIN is crucial for S-Corporations because they must prepare and distribute Schedule K-1 forms to each shareholder, reporting their share of the corporation's income, losses, deductions, and credits[^14][^15]. S-Corporations that are required to file 10 or more returns in a calendar year must e-file their Forms 1120-S[^14].

## Key Differences in EIN Usage

While both C-Corps and S-Corps require EINs, their usage differs based on the corporations' distinct tax structures:

### Tax Filing Deadlines

| Corporation Type | Form Required | Filing Deadline | Extension Deadline |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| C-Corporation | Form 1120 | April 15 | October 15 |
| S-Corporation | Form 1120-S | March 15 | September 15 |

### Tax Treatment Differences

**C-Corporations are separate taxable entities that must file federal corporate income tax returns and pay corporate taxes**[^12][^9]. They use Form 1120 to calculate their taxes due and face double taxation on distributed profits[^12][^2].

**S-Corporations are pass-through entities that use Form 1120-S as an information return**[^12][^9]. The corporation itself doesn't pay federal corporate income taxes; instead, profits and losses flow through to shareholders who report them on their individual tax returns[^12][^14].

## Employment Tax Considerations

Both C-Corps and S-Corps with employees must use their EIN for employment tax purposes[^2][^14]. This includes filing Form 941 (Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return) and Form 940 (Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return)[^2][^17].

**S-Corporations have additional payroll tax requirements**[^9]. Shareholder-employees must receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, and distributions cannot be used to avoid payroll taxes[^9]. This area receives heavy IRS scrutiny, making proper EIN usage critical for compliance.

## EIN Application Process for Corporations

The application process for obtaining an EIN is identical for both C-Corps and S-Corps[^3][^18]. **You must form your entity with your state before applying for an EIN**[^3][^18]. If you don't form your entity with your state first, your EIN application may be delayed[^18].

### Application Methods

1. **Online Application**: The fastest method, providing immediate EIN issuance (available Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time)[^3]
2. **Fax Application**: Submit Form SS-4 by fax; receive your EIN in approximately 4 business days[^3]
3. **Mail Application**: Mail Form SS-4; processing takes about 4-5 weeks[^3]
4. **Phone Application**: Available for international applicants at 267-941-1099[^3]

**You can apply for only 1 EIN per responsible party per day**, whether online or by other methods[^3][^18].

## When Corporations Need a New EIN

**Corporations need a new EIN when there are significant changes to ownership or structure**[^19][^20]. Specific situations requiring a new EIN for corporations include:

- Forming a new corporation with the Secretary of State[^19]
- A corporation becoming a subsidiary of another corporation[^19]
- Converting from a corporation to a partnership or sole proprietorship[^19]
- Creating a new corporation after a statutory merger[^19]

**Corporations do not need a new EIN for**[^19][^20]:

- Changing the corporate name or address[^19][^20]
- The surviving corporation after a merger[^19]
- Converting from C-Corp to S-Corp tax election[^20]
- Declaring bankruptcy (though a liquidating trust would need its own EIN)[^19]


## State-Level Considerations

**EINs are federal identifiers that remain consistent across all states**[^21]. A corporation with an EIN from one state can operate in any other state using the same federal tax ID[^21]. However, some states may require separate state tax identification numbers for state-specific tax obligations[^5][^21].

The EIN requirement and application process remain uniform regardless of the state where you incorporate your C-Corp or S-Corp[^21]. Federal tax obligations tied to your EIN apply consistently across all jurisdictions[^21].

## Conclusion

Both C-Corporations and S-Corporations have mandatory EIN requirements under federal tax law[^1][^4]. While the application process and basic EIN functions remain identical, the two corporate structures use their tax IDs differently based on their distinct tax treatments and filing obligations[^2][^14]. C-Corps use their EIN for direct corporate tax liability and Form 1120 filing, while S-Corps use theirs for pass-through reporting via Form 1120-S[^12][^9]. Understanding these differences ensures proper compliance with federal tax requirements and helps corporations maintain good standing with the IRS.
