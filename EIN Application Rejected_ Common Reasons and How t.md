# EIN Application Rejected? Common Reasons and How to Fix Them

Applying for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) is a crucial step for businesses, but sometimes applications get rejected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Understanding why your EIN application was denied and knowing how to address these issues can save you time and frustration. This comprehensive guide explores the most common reasons for EIN application rejections and provides practical solutions to help you successfully obtain your EIN.

## What is an EIN and Why Do You Need One?

An Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, is a nine-digit number assigned by the IRS to business entities for tax filing and reporting purposes[^1]. Think of it as a Social Security Number for your business[^2].

An EIN is essential for:

- Filing business tax returns[^1]
- Opening business bank accounts[^1]
- Hiring employees[^1]
- Building business credit[^2]
- Applying for business licenses and permits[^1]


## Common Reasons for EIN Application Rejection

### 1. Entity Name Conflict (Reference Number 101)

One of the most common reasons for rejection is when your business name conflicts with an existing entity in the IRS database[^3][^4][^5].

This typically occurs when:

- Your entity name is not unique and the IRS finds a similar one[^3]
- A company from another state has the same or similar name[^6]
- Your business name closely resembles another existing business[^6][^5]


### 2. Multiple States Listed on Application

If your application shows different states for your business incorporation and physical address, it can cause a "101 error"[^3][^6]. The IRS checks that the entity name is unique in each state mentioned before issuing an EIN[^3].

### 3. Responsible Party Issues

The IRS requires a qualified responsible party when applying for an EIN[^7]. Your application may be rejected if:

- You are already registered as a responsible party for another EIN that was approved recently[^3]
- The responsible party's name and Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) don't match IRS records[^8][^5]
- You've attempted to list an entity rather than an individual as the responsible party[^7]

Remember, the IRS only allows one EIN application per responsible party per day[^9][^10].

### 4. Incomplete or Inaccurate Information

Providing incomplete or incorrect information is a major reason for EIN application rejection[^1][^6]. The IRS is very particular about the details you provide, and even minor errors can lead to denial[^1].

Common information errors include:

- Misspelled names[^1]
- Incorrect Social Security Numbers[^1]
- Missing required fields[^1]
- Inconsistent business structure information[^1]


### 5. Electronic Numbers Issue

If you previously obtained an EIN electronically, you might face restrictions when trying to get another EIN online[^3]. This is particularly true if your existing EIN begins with certain numbers (20, 26, 27, 45, 46, or 47)[^3].

### 6. Duplicate Applications

Submitting multiple EIN applications for the same business can result in rejection[^1][^6]. This might happen if:

- You accidentally submitted the form more than once[^1]
- You filed under a different name, but the business information is the same[^1]
- You already have an EIN but have forgotten it[^11]


### 7. Business Structure Inconsistency

If your business name or structure is not consistent across all forms submitted to the IRS, your application may be rejected[^1][^12]. For example, listing your business as an LLC in one form and as a Sole Proprietorship in another will cause inconsistency flags[^1].

## How to Fix EIN Application Rejections

### Resolving Reference Number 101 (Name Conflict)

If you receive a Reference Number 101 error:

1. Call the IRS at 800-829-4933 to understand if there's anything special about your circumstances[^13]
2. Submit Form SS-4 via mail or fax along with your authorized LLC filing document (Articles of Organization, Certificate of Organization, or Certificate of Formation)[^8][^5]
3. Include proof of your approved LLC filing form with Form SS-4 when sending it to the IRS[^14]

You don't need to change your LLC name - just apply using Form SS-4 instead of the online application[^14][^5].

### Fixing Responsible Party Issues (Reference Number 102)

If your application is rejected due to SSN/ITIN mismatch:

1. Double-check the SSN or ITIN you've entered and make sure it's correct[^8][^14]
2. If the error persists, file Form SS-4 by mail or fax so a real person can review your application[^8][^14]
3. Ensure the responsible party is an individual, not an entity[^7]

### Addressing Multiple States Error

To fix issues related to multiple states listed on your application:

1. Ensure all state information matches throughout your application[^12]
2. If your business is incorporated in one state but has a physical address in another, consider applying via Form SS-4 instead of online[^3][^6]
3. Be consistent with the state information you provide[^12]

### Correcting Incomplete or Inaccurate Information

If your application was rejected due to incomplete information:

1. Carefully review your application before resubmitting[^1]
2. Verify that your name, address, and Social Security number are correct[^1]
3. Ensure you haven't missed any required sections[^1]
4. Double-check each field for accuracy[^1]

### Resolving Duplicate Application Issues

If your application was rejected because you may already have an EIN:

1. Search your files for previous EIN documentation[^1]
2. Contact the IRS to recover your existing EIN rather than applying for a new one[^1]
3. If you believe you submitted multiple applications, wait for the IRS to process your first application instead of submitting again[^1]

### Fixing Business Structure Inconsistency

To address business structure inconsistency:

1. Maintain consistency across your entire application[^1]
2. Ensure business name, structure, and other information are identical across all forms submitted[^1]
3. Consider consulting a legal expert or accountant if you're unsure about your business structure before applying[^1]

## Alternative Application Methods

If your online application is rejected, consider these alternative methods:

### Applying by Fax

1. Complete Form SS-4 (Application for Employer Identification Number)[^9][^15]
2. Fax it to 855-641-6935 (for U.S. applicants)[^9]
3. If you provide a fax number, the IRS will fax a cover sheet with the EIN back to you in approximately 4 business days[^9]

### Applying by Mail

1. Fill out Form SS-4[^9][^15]
2. Mail it to: Internal Revenue Service, Attn: EIN Operation, Cincinnati, OH 45999[^9]
3. You'll receive your EIN in about 4 weeks[^9]

### Applying by Phone

1. For international applicants, call 267-941-1099 Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time[^9]
2. For domestic applicants, call 800-829-4933[^3][^4]
3. Have your information ready and mention any reference number you received[^4]

## Professional Assistance Options

If you continue to face difficulties with your EIN application, consider seeking professional help:

1. Use a third-party service that specializes in EIN applications[^10][^2]
2. Consult with a tax professional or accountant familiar with IRS procedures[^1]
3. Work with a business formation service that can handle the EIN application process for you[^5][^2]

These services can navigate the complexities of the application process and help resolve any issues that arise.

## Preventing Future EIN Application Issues

To avoid EIN application rejections in the future:

1. Research your business name thoroughly before applying to ensure it's unique[^6]
2. Gather all necessary information before starting the online application, as sessions time out after 15 minutes of inactivity[^16]
3. Apply for only one EIN per day per responsible party[^9][^10]
4. Keep your EIN information current by using Form 8822-B to report changes to your responsible party, address, or location[^15][^17]
5. Double-check all information for accuracy before submitting[^1]

## Conclusion

While EIN application rejections can be frustrating, they're usually fixable with the right approach. By understanding the common reasons for rejection and following the appropriate steps to address them, you can successfully obtain your EIN and move forward with your business operations.

Remember that the IRS provides multiple application methods, and if one doesn't work, another might be more suitable for your situation. When in doubt, don't hesitate to contact the IRS directly or seek professional assistance to guide you through the process.
