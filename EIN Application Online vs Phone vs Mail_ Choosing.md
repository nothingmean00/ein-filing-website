# EIN Application Online vs Phone vs Mail: Choosing the Best Method for Your Business

In today's fast-paced business environment, obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN) is a crucial step for entrepreneurs and business owners[^1]. This unique nine-digit number, issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), serves as your business's tax identification number and is essential for various business operations[^2]. Whether you're starting a new venture, hiring employees, or opening a business bank account, having an EIN is often a requirement[^3].

When it comes to applying for an EIN, the IRS offers three primary methods: online, phone, and mail[^4]. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, processing times, and specific requirements[^5]. Understanding these differences can help you choose the most efficient method for your particular situation[^6].

## What is an Employer Identification Number (EIN)?

An Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, functions as a Social Security Number for your business[^7]. It's a unique nine-digit identifier that the IRS uses to track your business entity for tax purposes[^8]. This number is essential for tax administration and helps distinguish your business in various financial and legal contexts[^9].

Every organization must have an EIN, even if it will not have employees[^2]. The number is necessary for:

- Opening business bank accounts[^10]
- Filing tax returns[^3]
- Hiring employees[^10]
- Applying for business licenses and permits[^10]
- Establishing business credit[^11]


## Online EIN Application: The Digital Advantage

The online application method has become the preferred choice for most business owners due to its convenience and efficiency[^11]. When you apply online through the IRS website, you can receive your EIN immediately upon completion of the application[^12].

### Benefits of Online EIN Application

1. **Immediate Results**: The most significant advantage of applying online is the instant issuance of your EIN[^12]. Once you complete the application, your number is provided immediately, allowing you to proceed with other business tasks without delay[^13].
2. **Convenience and Accessibility**: The online application is available 24/7, enabling you to apply at your convenience without waiting for office hours[^13]. This flexibility is particularly valuable for busy entrepreneurs who may need to handle administrative tasks outside of regular business hours[^13].
3. **User-Friendly Process**: The IRS online application uses an interview-style format that guides you through each step, making it easier to provide the correct information[^6]. The system includes prompts and explanations that help clarify what information is needed[^12].
4. **No Paperwork**: The digital process eliminates the need for printing, signing, and mailing forms, reducing the paperwork typically associated with government applications[^13].
5. **Time Efficiency**: The entire online application process typically takes only about 10-15 minutes to complete, saving you valuable time that can be better spent on growing your business[^8].

### Eligibility Requirements for Online Application

While the online method offers numerous advantages, not all applicants qualify to use it[^1]. To apply for an EIN online, you must meet these requirements:

- Your principal business must be located in the United States or U.S. territories[^6]
- The responsible party must have a valid Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)[^6]
- You can only apply for one EIN per day[^4]


### Important Considerations for Online Applications

When applying online, keep in mind that the application must be completed in one session[^1]. The system does not save your progress, and sessions time out after 15 minutes of inactivity[^1]. Therefore, it's advisable to gather all necessary information before starting the application[^6].

## Phone EIN Application: The Direct Approach

For those who prefer speaking with a representative or don't qualify for the online application, applying by phone is an alternative option[^14]. This method involves calling the IRS Business and Specialty Tax Line and providing your information verbally[^15].

### How to Apply by Phone

To apply for an EIN by phone, follow these steps:

1. Call the IRS Business and Specialty Tax Line at 1-800-829-4933 (for domestic applicants) or 267-941-1099 (for international applicants)[^14][^15]
2. The line is available Monday through Friday, from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time[^14]
3. Follow the prompts and select options related to EIN inquiries[^15]
4. Provide your business details to the IRS representative[^15]
5. The representative will issue your EIN over the phone if your application is approved[^15]

### Advantages of Phone Application

1. **Direct Assistance**: Speaking with an IRS representative allows you to ask questions and receive guidance throughout the application process[^15].
2. **Immediate Clarification**: If there are any issues or confusion regarding your application, you can address them immediately during the call[^16].
3. **Required for International Applicants**: For businesses with their principal place outside the United States, the phone method is recommended by the IRS[^4].

### Disadvantages of Phone Application

1. **Wait Times**: One significant drawback is the potential for long wait times, especially during peak tax seasons[^16]. The average wait time can be between 1 and 1.5 hours[^16].
2. **Limited Availability**: The phone service is only available during specific hours, which may not align with your schedule[^14].
3. **Language Barriers**: For non-native English speakers, communicating complex business information over the phone might be challenging[^5].

## Mail EIN Application: The Traditional Method

The mail application method involves completing Form SS-4 (Application for Employer Identification Number) and sending it to the IRS by postal mail[^5]. While this is the most traditional approach, it also has the longest processing time[^17].

### How to Apply by Mail

To apply for an EIN by mail, follow these steps:

1. Download and complete Form SS-4 from the IRS website[^5]
2. Ensure all information is accurate and the form is signed[^5]
3. Mail the completed form to the appropriate IRS address based on your business location[^18]
4. Wait for the IRS to process your application and mail back your EIN[^5]

### Advantages of Mail Application

1. **No Technology Required**: The mail method doesn't require internet access or phone availability, making it accessible to everyone regardless of technological capabilities[^5].
2. **Paper Trail**: Some business owners prefer having physical documentation of their application process[^5].
3. **No Time Constraints**: Unlike the online application, there's no session timeout to worry about, allowing you to take your time completing the form[^5].

### Disadvantages of Mail Application

1. **Extended Processing Time**: The most significant drawback is the lengthy processing time, which can take 4-5 weeks[^11]. This delay can potentially hold up other important business activities that require an EIN[^17].
2. **Risk of Postal Delays**: Relying on postal services introduces the possibility of mail getting lost or delayed[^17].
3. **No Immediate Confirmation**: Unlike online or phone applications, you won't receive immediate confirmation that your application has been received[^5].

## Processing Time Comparison

The processing time varies significantly depending on which application method you choose[^17]:


| Application Method | Processing Time |
| :-- | :-- |
| Online | Immediate (same day) |
| Phone | Immediate (during the call) |
| Fax | About 4 business days |
| Mail | 4-5 weeks |

This substantial difference in processing time is often the deciding factor for many business owners when choosing their application method[^17].

## Security Considerations

When applying for an EIN, security is an important consideration as the application requires sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers or Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers[^19].

### Online Security

The IRS employs encryption and other security measures to protect applicants' sensitive data during online applications[^13]. However, it's always advisable to use a secure, private internet connection when submitting your application[^20].

### Mail Security

While traditional mail might seem less secure than digital methods, some applicants prefer it for sensitive information[^19]. If choosing this method, consider using certified mail with return receipt to track your application and confirm delivery[^21].

### Best Practices for EIN Security

Regardless of which application method you choose, protecting your EIN after you receive it is crucial[^19]. Some security best practices include:

1. Store your EIN confirmation letter in a secure location[^5]
2. Limit access to your EIN to only those who need it for business purposes[^19]
3. Monitor your business credit reports regularly for unauthorized activity[^19]
4. Use secure methods when sharing your EIN with vendors, clients, or financial institutions[^19]

## Common Errors to Avoid

Mistakes during the EIN application process can lead to delays or rejection[^22]. Here are some common errors to avoid:

### Inaccurate Information

Providing incorrect information is one of the most common reasons for application rejection[^22]. Double-check all details, especially:

- Business name and address[^22]
- Responsible party's name and tax identification number[^22]
- Business entity type[^22]


### Entity Type Selection

Choosing the wrong entity type can have significant tax and legal implications[^22]. Make sure you understand the differences between sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and other business structures before selecting one on your application[^22].

### One EIN Per Day Limitation

The IRS only issues one EIN per responsible party per day, regardless of the application method[^23]. If you need multiple EINs for different entities, you'll need to space out your applications[^23].

## When to Consider Professional EIN Application Services

While applying for an EIN is a process many business owners can handle themselves, there are situations where professional assistance might be beneficial[^10]. Services like EIN National Filing can help streamline the application process and provide expert guidance.

### Benefits of Using Professional Services

1. **Expertise and Experience**: Professional services are familiar with the EIN application process and can help avoid common pitfalls[^10].
2. **Time Savings**: Outsourcing the application process allows you to focus on other aspects of your business[^10].
3. **Reduced Errors**: Professionals can ensure all information is accurate and complete, reducing the risk of rejection or delays[^10].
4. **Support for Complex Situations**: For businesses with unique circumstances or international components, professional guidance can be particularly valuable[^10].
5. **Expedited Processing**: Some services have established relationships with the IRS that may help expedite the application process[^10].

## Special Considerations for Different Business Types

Different business structures may have specific requirements or considerations when applying for an EIN[^3].

### Sole Proprietorships

Sole proprietors without employees are not required to have an EIN but may still benefit from obtaining one to separate personal and business finances[^3].

### Partnerships and LLCs

Partnerships and multi-member LLCs must have an EIN, even if they don't have employees[^3]. Single-member LLCs may use the owner's Social Security Number but often choose to get an EIN for business banking and liability protection[^3].

### Corporations

All corporations, including S corporations and C corporations, must have an EIN for tax filing purposes[^3].

### Non-Profit Organizations

Non-profit organizations require an EIN to apply for tax-exempt status and file required returns[^2].

## Conclusion: Choosing the Right Method for Your Business

When deciding between online, phone, or mail application methods for your EIN, consider your specific business needs, timeline, and eligibility[^5].

The online application is clearly the most efficient option for eligible applicants, offering immediate EIN issuance and a user-friendly process[^11]. For international businesses or those who prefer direct assistance, the phone method provides a good alternative despite potential wait times[^4]. The mail application, while the slowest option, remains available for those who prefer traditional methods or don't have access to the internet[^5].

Regardless of which method you choose, ensuring accuracy in your application is crucial to avoid delays and complications[^22]. For businesses seeking additional support or facing complex situations, professional EIN application services like EIN National Filing can provide valuable expertise and assistance throughout the process.

Obtaining your EIN is an important step in establishing your business identity and enabling various essential business activities[^2]. By understanding the different application methods and choosing the one that best suits your needs, you can efficiently secure this crucial business identifier and move forward with confidence in your entrepreneurial journey.
