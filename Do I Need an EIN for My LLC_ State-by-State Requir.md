# Do I Need an EIN for My LLC? State-by-State Requirements

An Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to identify businesses for tax purposes[^1]. For LLC owners, understanding whether you need an EIN is crucial for proper business operation and tax compliance[^2]. While federal requirements establish baseline rules, state-specific requirements can add additional layers of complexity to this decision[^3].

## Federal EIN Requirements for LLCs

Before examining state-specific requirements, it's important to understand the federal guidelines that apply to all LLCs regardless of location:

### Multi-Member LLCs

All LLCs with two or more members (owners) must obtain an EIN, regardless of how the LLC is taxed (as a partnership or corporation)[^4]. This is a federal requirement that applies across all states[^2].

### Single-Member LLCs

For single-member LLCs, federal requirements are more nuanced:

- By default, a single-member LLC is treated as a "disregarded entity" for federal tax purposes, meaning the IRS doesn't recognize it as a separate taxable entity[^5].
- Single-member LLCs without employees can technically use the owner's Social Security Number (SSN) for tax filing purposes instead of an EIN[^1][^2].
- However, a single-member LLC must obtain an EIN if it:
    - Has employees[^1][^6]
    - Pays excise taxes[^1][^4]
    - Files excise tax returns[^6]
    - Elects to be taxed as a corporation rather than a sole proprietorship[^2][^4]
    - Has a Keogh plan or solo 401(k) retirement plan[^6][^7]
    - Files for bankruptcy[^6]


## Benefits of Getting an EIN Even When Not Required

Even when not legally required, obtaining an EIN offers several advantages for single-member LLCs:

- Helps establish business credibility[^4][^7]
- Allows you to open a business bank account (most banks require an EIN)[^4][^8]
- Protects your personal identity by avoiding the use of your SSN on business documents[^4][^7]
- Helps establish business credit separate from personal credit[^4]
- Simplifies the process if you later add members or employees[^2]
- Provides clearer separation between personal and business finances, strengthening liability protection[^5][^7]


## State-by-State EIN Requirements for LLCs

While EINs are issued by the federal government, state requirements can influence when you need one. Here's a breakdown of EIN requirements by state:

### California

- All California LLCs with employees must have an EIN[^9]
- Single-member LLCs without employees can use the owner's SSN for federal tax purposes, but most banks will require an EIN to open a business bank account[^9][^10]
- An EIN is necessary for obtaining various business licenses and permits in California[^10]


### New York

- Multi-member LLCs must have an EIN for federal tax purposes[^11]
- Single-member LLCs treated as disregarded entities must report business income on the member's New York State personal income tax returns[^11]
- If you plan on having employees, your LLC must have an EIN and register for payroll tax and unemployment insurance with New York State[^12]


### Texas

- Texas LLCs need an EIN if they will be taxed like a corporation or partnership, hire W2 employees, pay federal excise taxes, or open a bank account[^13]
- Starting January 2024, the Corporate Transparency Act requires all LLCs to submit a beneficial owner information report that includes the LLC's EIN[^13]


### Florida

- All Florida corporations must have an EIN[^14]

- Single-member LLCs in Florida without employees can use the owner's SSN, but an EIN is recommended for banking and other business purposes[^15]


### Delaware

- Even when not required, Delaware LLC owners often obtain an EIN to avoid using their SSN for business purposes[^16]
- An EIN is typically needed for opening a business bank account in Delaware[^16]


### Illinois

- Single-member LLCs without employees are not required to have an EIN in Illinois[^17]
- However, if a single-member LLC in Illinois doesn't have an EIN, they must complete a paper version of Form REG-1 (Illinois Business Registration Application) rather than filing online[^17]
- All other Illinois businesses must request an EIN from the IRS[^17]


### Washington

- Every Washington corporation must have an EIN[^18]
- Washington LLCs need an EIN if they have employees, file certain tax returns, withhold taxes on income paid to non-resident aliens, or have a Keogh plan[^18]
- Washington LLCs also need an EIN if they're involved with trusts, estates, real estate mortgage investment conduits, non-profit organizations, farmers' cooperatives, or plan administrators[^18]


### Nevada

- Nevada LLCs need an EIN to open business bank accounts, file federal and state tax returns, obtain business loans, and apply for business licenses or permits[^19]
- An EIN is required for all multi-member LLCs in Nevada[^19]
- Single-member LLCs in Nevada without employees can use the owner's SSN for federal tax purposes, but an EIN is recommended for banking and other business purposes[^19]


### Wyoming

- Wyoming LLCs need an EIN for banking purposes, starting a new business, or other entity-related activities[^20]
- The application process for Wyoming-based EINs follows the standard federal procedure through the IRS website[^20]


### Massachusetts

- An EIN is also needed to file federal, state, and local tax returns in Massachusetts[^21]
- All multi-member LLCs in Massachusetts must have an EIN[^21]


### Colorado

- All multi-member Colorado LLCs must have an EIN[^22]
- Single-member LLCs in Colorado without employees can use the owner's SSN for federal tax purposes, but an EIN is recommended for banking and other business purposes[^22]


## Special Considerations for Non-US Residents

If you're a non-US resident forming an LLC in the United States:

- You can still form an LLC and obtain an EIN in any state[^23]
- You'll need a Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to apply for an EIN online[^24][^25]
- Without an SSN or ITIN, you must apply for an EIN by mail or fax using Form SS-4[^24][^10]
- Some states have specific procedures for non-US residents applying for state tax registrations[^25]


## How to Apply for an EIN

Regardless of your state, the process for obtaining an EIN is consistent since it's a federal identifier:

1. **Online Application**: The fastest method, providing immediate EIN issuance (available Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time)[^26]
2. **Fax Application**: Submit Form SS-4 by fax; receive your EIN in approximately 4 business days[^9][^13]
3. **Mail Application**: Mail Form SS-4 to the IRS; processing takes about 4-5 weeks[^9][^13]
4. **Phone Application**: Available for international applicants[^13]

Important notes about the application process:

- There is no fee to obtain an EIN from the IRS[^26][^9]
- You can only apply for one EIN per responsible party per day[^26]
- Form your LLC with your state before applying for an EIN to avoid delays[^26]
- Online applications must be completed in one session (no saving progress)[^20]


## Conclusion

While federal requirements establish when an EIN is legally necessary, practical business considerations often make obtaining an EIN advisable even when not strictly required[^4][^5]. Multi-member LLCs across all states must have an EIN, while single-member LLCs without employees technically have the option to use the owner's SSN instead[^2][^4].

However, most business activities—including opening bank accounts, applying for business loans, and establishing business credit—typically require an EIN regardless of your LLC structure[^4][^8]. Since obtaining an EIN is free and relatively simple, most LLC owners choose to get one even when not legally required to do so[^6][^4].

Before making your decision, consider both the federal requirements and any state-specific considerations that might apply to your LLC's location and business activities[^3][^27]. When in doubt, consulting with a tax professional familiar with your state's requirements can provide clarity tailored to your specific situation[^4].
