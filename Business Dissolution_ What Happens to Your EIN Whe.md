# Business Dissolution: What Happens to Your EIN When Closing

When a business closes, its Employer Identification Number (EIN) remains a permanent federal taxpayer identification number assigned by the IRS to that entity. Even after dissolution, the EIN cannot be reused, reassigned, or formally canceled, but the associated IRS business account can be closed or deactivated through specified procedures.

## 1. Filing Final Tax Returns and Related Forms

Before addressing the EIN, you must complete all tax obligations. This involves:

- Filing a final income tax return for the year of closure, checking the “final return” box on the appropriate federal forms (e.g., Form 1040 Schedule C for sole proprietors, Form 1065 for partnerships, Form 1120 for C corporations, or Form 1120-S for S corporations) [^1].
- Reporting the sale or exchange of business property on Form 4797 if applicable [^1].
- Filing Form 966 to document corporate dissolution or liquidation when closing a corporation [^1].


## 2. Settling Employment and Contractor Obligations

If the business had employees or contractors, you must:

- Pay final wages and file Form 941 or 944, marking it as final, and Form 940 for unemployment taxes [^1].
- Issue Form W-2 to employees and Form 1099-NEC to contractors who received \$600 or more, transmitting information returns with Form 1096 as needed [^1].
- Terminate any retirement or benefit plans, following IRS guidance for plan termination [^1].


## 3. Closing the IRS Business Account

Once all tax filings are made and taxes paid, you can close or deactivate the IRS business account associated with your EIN. The steps are:

1. Prepare a written request on company letterhead stating:
    - Legal business name
    - EIN
    - Business address
    - Reason for closing the account
2. Include a copy of the original EIN Assignment Notice, if available [^1].
3. Mail the letter to:
Internal Revenue Service
Cincinnati, OH 45999 [^1].

For exempt organizations seeking to deactivate an EIN, a similar letter should be sent to the Ogden, UT address or faxed, and all outstanding returns must be filed first [^2].

## 4. Permanent Status of the EIN

- The IRS does **not** cancel or reassign EINs once issued; the number remains permanently tied to the entity [^2].
- Deactivation or account closure simply prevents further filings under that EIN but does not eliminate the number from IRS records [^1][^2].


## 5. Record Retention

Maintain business records for IRS audit and reference purposes:

- Property records until the period of limitations ends for the year of disposition [^1].
- Employment tax records for at least four years [^1].

By following these steps—filing final returns, settling payroll and contractor obligations, and formally closing the IRS account—you ensure proper dissolution of your business and appropriate handling of the associated EIN.
